Focus ring styling is disabled by default and instead we are using the :focus-ring polyfill. The
:focus-ring pseudo selector is a future browser standard that differentiates between mouse
and keyboard usage when determining whether to draw a focus ring. Usually we only want a
focus ring in the latter case.
