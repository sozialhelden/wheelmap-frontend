[Wheelmap.org](https://www.wheelmap.org) by [Sozialhelden e.V.](https://sozialhelden.de) is the world’s largest free online map for accessible places.

[<img alt="Sozialhelden e.V." src='./doc/sozialhelden-logo.svg' width="200" style="vertical-align: middle;">](https://sozialhelden.de)

This project contains the Node.js/React.js-based frontend for the app.

## Development

The app itself is a [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) application, and [wrapped into native apps](https://github.com/sozialhelden/wheelmap-native-wrapper) for Android and iOS. [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) provides a server and webpack compilation process. For CSS styling, we use [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com).

The web server serves the app as server-side rendered static page, and runs on the same domain as the backend API in production.

### Setup

Prepare your development environment:

```bash
# Environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# npm dependencies
npm install

# install transifex i18n / localization tool
pip install transifex-client

# start a local test web server
npm run dev
```

You will get some error messages from the Elastic APM client (our error collector for both [server](https://www.elastic.co/products/apm) and [client](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/rum-js/4.x/getting-started.html)). If you want to test/develop the Elastic APM integration, you can get a valid token from the project maintainers.

You can configure the app using process environment variables or a `.env` file. Process environment variables override values set in the `.env` file. Note that the build configuration [deviates from Webpack’s default behavior](https://github.com/sozialhelden/twelve-factor-dotenv) to improve build and bug reproducibility.

### Recompile SVG

You have to convert SVG graphics to React JS components to make them styleable with CSS. Run this command:

```bash
npm run compile-svgs
```

Check `package.json`, it defines more scripts that can speed up this task.

## Website deployment

To deploy the web application:

- ask the backend maintainers to include your public SSH key in the authorized deployment keys
- Add hostnames for the staging/production systems to your `/etc/hosts`
- Log in once on the staging/production server
- Deploy the application with `npm run deploy-staging` or `npm run deploy-production`.

## Embedding Wheelmap as a widget on other websites

You can embed the Wheelmap web app in any other website’s HTML like this:

```<iframe style="width: 600px; height: 600px;" src="https://wheelmap.org?embedded=true&embedToken=12345&lat=52.5212&lon=13.4104" allow="geolocation"></iframe>```

Having the `embedded=true` query parameter attached to the URL ensures that the app renders less UI (no search, no header etc.). Add `allow="geolocation"` to let the `<iframe>` access the browser’s location feature.
Like the full app, the widget can initially position the map at a certain location defined by `lat` and `lon` URL parameters.
The app disallows embedding via `<iframe>` if you provide no valid `embedToken` URL parameter. You can create an embed token on accessibility.cloud’s app admin interface (in the widget options).

## Translation process

Ensure the transifex client is setup https://docs.transifex.com/client/client-configuration#-transifexrc

Use `npm run push-translations` to push a new translation resource to our translation service [transifex](http://transifex.com).

We deploy every new feature in English and German first, and add support for all languages in the following sprint.

When there are new strings on transifex, you can run `npm run pull-translations` to pull them into the local project.

Then run `npm run create-js-translations` to inject the translations into the application.

We have a retranslate tool that allows to use the `en_US` language on transifex to refine source strings directly in the source code. This parses the whole source code into an abstract syntax tree using Babel, then re-assembles it with new versions of the strings fetched from the `en_US` locale. Re-assembly can break formatting.

## Testing

<a href="https://browserstack.com"><img src="src/public/images/Browserstack-logo.svg" width="200px"></a>

For testing the apps, we use [BrowserStack](https://browserstack.com) - it can run test suites on variout browsers and live devices. Currently, our testing happens mostly manually on [BrowserStack Live](https://www.browserstack.com/live), but pull requests will soon get automatic CI checks using [BrowserStack Automate](https://www.browserstack.com/automate) and [BrowserStack App Automate](https://www.browserstack.com/app-automate). We thank the BrowserStack team for their great products and their support! ❤️
