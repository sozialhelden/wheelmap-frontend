# This is a multi-stage build to optimize image size.

# 1) First, we build the base image to have it cached on rebuilds.
# See https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/ for a release support roadmap.
# Prefer even version numbers, they have active long-term support.
FROM node:17.9-slim AS base

# Create app directory
WORKDIR /usr/app

# Cache necessary files for npm install
COPY package.json .
COPY package-lock.json .

# 2) Now we create a new image in which we install dependencies necessary for building our app.
#    This will create a lot of clutter that we don't want to include in our final image to push.
FROM base AS buildenv
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
  ca-certificates \
  g++ \
  build-essential \

  && apt-get clean \
  && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

RUN npm set progress=false && npm config set depth 0
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN touch .env && NODE_ENV=production npm run build && npm prune --production && rm -rf ./node_modules/.cache

# run linters, setup and tests
# FROM buildenv AS test
# COPY . .
# RUN  npm run lint && npm run setup && npm run test

# 3) The build is done! Now we create a third image, based on the base image from the beginning.
#    In this third image, we extract only the minimal necessary set of files to run the app. The
#    result is what we will push to the registry.
