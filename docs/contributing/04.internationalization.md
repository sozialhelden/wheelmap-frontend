# Internationalization

## Translation process

Ensure the transifex client is setup <https://docs.transifex.com/client/client-configuration#-transifexrc>

Use `npm run push-translations` to push a new translation resource to our translation service [transifex](http://transifex.com).

We deploy every new feature in English and German first, and add support for all languages in the following sprint.

After pushing new strings, translators can begin translating them on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/sozialhelden/wheelmap-react-frontend/translate/#de/translationspot/335454735?q=translated%3Ano).

When there are new strings on transifex, you can run `npm run pull-translations` to pull them into the local project and to inject the translations into the application.

We have a retranslate tool that allows to use the `en_US` language on transifex to refine source strings directly in the source code. This parses the whole source code into an abstract syntax tree using Babel, then re-assembles it with new versions of the strings fetched from the `en_US` locale. Re-assembly can break formatting.
