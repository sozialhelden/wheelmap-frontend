# Icons

## Using SVG icons

This project uses the Next.js svgr plugin to import SVG icons as React components. In order to use an SVG icon, you can simply import it and use it like any other React component:

```typescript jsx
import MyIcon from '~/assets/icons/my-icon.svg';

export default function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <MyIcon /> How much is the fish?
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Map icons

The icons displayed on the map work a bit differently. They are configured in `src/modules/map/icons/index.ts`. There are two different types: simple icons and markers with category and accessibility grade. Both are rendered at runtime to a data-uri, which is then added to the map as image. To work effectively with map styles in Mapbox Studio, the icons are also rendered on the command line and uploaded to Mapbox Studio when running the `map:style:update` script or when a new map style is created initially. If you want to use new markers on the map, make sure to configure them in the config file above, run `map:style:update` to upload them to Mapbox Studio and then reference the name from the config in Mapbox Studio when styling the map.

> [!WARNING]
> Mapbox Studio has a limit of 1000 icons per style. We cut off the icons at 900, so some category icons might not be available in Mapbox Studio. They are still available in the app though.

> [!WARNING]
> Icons must be 25x25 pixel in size, otherwise there will be different icon sizes in the app and Mapbox Studio.
