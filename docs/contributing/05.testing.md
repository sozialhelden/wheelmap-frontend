# Testing

For automated testing, we use [PlayWright](https://playwright.dev) (which enables quick E2E tests locally and on CI) and [BrowserStack](https://browserstack.com) (for testing manually with [BrowserStack Live](https://www.browserstack.com/live)). We thank the PlayWright and BrowserStack teams for their great products and their support! ❤️

### Getting started

To test locally,
- [Install the PlayWright VSCode extension](https://playwright.dev/docs/getting-started-vscode),
- Run `npx playwright install --with-deps` to install PlayWright's browser binaries,
- Run `npm run test`.
