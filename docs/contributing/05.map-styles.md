# Map styles

## Workflow

The Mapbox map styles are part of this repository as JSON files in the `~/src/modules/map/styles/` folder. You can edit them by hand or use Mapbox Studio.

In order to improve the Mapbox Studio workflow, you should use the following npm scripts:

```bash
# Start editing map styles in Mapbox Studio
# This will create new temporary styles in Mapbox Studio based 
# on the local styles and icons.
npm run map:style:edit

# Download the map styles from Mapbox Studio
# ⚠️ This overwrites all changes made to the styles locally
# and replaces them with the latest version from Mapbox Studio.
npm run map:style:download

# Upload the local map styles to Mapbox Studio
# ⚠️ This overwrites all changes made to the styles in Mapbox 
# Studio and replaces them with the local ones.
npm run map:style:upload

# Finish editing the map styles in Mapbox Studio
# ⚠️ This will download the latest styles from Mapbox Studio and 
# overwrites the local styles. It also deletes the temporary 
# styles in Mapbox Studio.
npm run map:style:finish
```

Beside the styles, all the icons used in the map styles are also uploaded to Mapbox Studio. Other than styles, changes to the icons in Mapbox Studio will not be downloaded.
